### Game Map

The game maps were designed in Tiled, which can be downloaded [https://www.mapeditor.org/](here). The game maps can be found under the "GameMap" folder in the repository.

Once the game map is updated, export the file as a CSV file. Copy the CSV file into Game_Data.h (Physical Badge) or Game_Data.js/AllJavascript.js (Virtual Badge), following the array/matrix style required for the respective language.

### General Settings

General settings can be modified under Game_Data.h (Physical Badge) or Game_Data.js/AllJavascript.js (Virtual Badge).
